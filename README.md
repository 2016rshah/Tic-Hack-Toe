	$ cabal install Tic-Tac-Toe
	$ Tic-Tac-Toe

#TODO

I would love any contributions! Feel free to open up an issue or a PR if you think you can help. The code is pretty simple, so its even pretty beginner friendly.

 - Add tests
 - Fix AI to not just choose the first possible move if it doesn't have a move it needs to make
 - Apparently X goes first, not O, so fix that
 - Look into colored output for the X's and the O's for a better UI
